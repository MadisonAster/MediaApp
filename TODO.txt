######HIGH PRIORITY######
Add ActiveNode Property to AppCore (set mostly via properties bin)
    On ActiveNode open, if Node has self.ViewerOverlays, add toolbars to AllViewers, hand self.ViewerOverlays pointer to viewer
    On ActiveNode close, reset AllViewers toolbars to default, destroy ActiveNodeWidget pointers
    On viewer paint event, hand painter to ActiveNodeWidget to paint overlays
On generate frame for notePainter node, do some other stuff.





IconFromSvg file object constructor in icons package

Move CTI into Timeline Class. Separate certain features of timeline widget out into timeline class
so that they may be subclassed by ViewerWidget.

Allow for multiple CTI's in the timeline class, then establish an output position on node for each cti

Make it so that the viewer does an isinstance on it's input node, testing to see if the input is providing it's own
timeline and cache, if not the viewer will provide it.

provide a/b functions in viewer toolbar for different viewer inputs




NODE SUBCLASSES Figure out how to override methods like 'nodeShape' when Node becomes a child of TimelineWidget
specifically node['width'].setValue() and node['ypos'].setValue() are problems
called: duck typing, duck punching, or monkey patching

MediaCache class will be a subclass of deque that will enable list operations on it
by incurring the extra cost of a copy step
