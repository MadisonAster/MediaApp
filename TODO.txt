######HIGH PRIORITY######
Make it so that the viewer does an isinstance on it's input node, testing to see if the input is providing it's own
timeline and cache, if not the viewer will provide it.

Break GraphWidget paintEvent into several functions, so that parts of the paint event can be overridden by subclasses
Multiply positions of node by XY Unit sizes in the mode calculation for GraphWidget


NODE SUBCLASSES Figure out how to override methods like 'nodeShape' when Node becomes a child of TimelineWidget
specifically node['width'].setValue() and node['ypos'].setValue() are problems
called: duck typing, duck punching, or monkey patching


Make Timeline Node subclass, with generateImage override that passes up TimelineWidget.getNodeAtPos() instead of self.input()
Maybe there's a way to replace ancestral class in createNode override for TimelineWidget
